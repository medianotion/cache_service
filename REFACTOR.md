# REFACTOR.md

This document tracks the iterative refactoring journey for the Cache Service repository.

## Repository Summary

Cache Service is a .NET Standard 2.1 library that provides a Redis-based caching solution with built-in reliability features. The library wraps StackExchange.Redis and adds Polly retry policies for better error handling. It supports all major Redis data types (strings, lists, sets, hashes, counters) with automatic TTL management.

**Current Architecture:**
- Provider pattern with `ICacheProvider` and `RedisCacheProvider`
- Configuration-based setup with `CacheOptions`
- Dependency injection support via `ServiceCollectionExtensions`
- Interface-based design with `ICache`
- Built-in retry policies using Polly

## Next Steps

*Update this section with your planned refactoring tasks*
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout cache operations
- [ ] Implement cache hit/miss metrics and performance monitoring  
- [ ] Add support for distributed cache patterns
- [ ] Consider upgrading target framework from .NET Standard 2.1 to .NET 6/8
 
## Overall Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Convert to Provider Pattern**: Replace the current factory pattern with a more flexible provider pattern that supports dependency injection and configuration
- **Add Configuration Support**: Implement a configuration system for Redis connection settings, retry policies, and TTL defaults
- **Improve Testability**: Enhance the codebase to support better unit testing and mocking scenarios
- **Add Logging**: Integrate structured logging throughout the cache operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize Redis operations for better performance

### Secondary Goals
- **Add Multiple Provider Support**: Extend beyond Redis to support other cache providers (in-memory, distributed cache)
- **Add Monitoring/Metrics**: Implement cache hit/miss metrics and performance monitoring
- **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling with more specific exception types
- **Add Async Configuration**: Support dynamic configuration updates without service restart
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Add comprehensive XML documentation and usage examples

### Technical Debt Goals
- **Upgrade Target Framework**: Consider upgrading from .NET Standard 2.1 to .NET 6/8
- **Update Dependencies**: Update to latest versions of StackExchange.Redis and Polly
- **Code Coverage**: Improve test coverage to 90%+
- **Static Analysis**: Add code analysis rules and fix any violations

### Iteration 5 - Dead Code Removal
- **Date**: 2025-07-02
- **Goal**: Remove unused internal methods and clean up codebase
- **Changes Made**:
  - [x] Removed unused `ToRedisValueArray` method from Redis.cs (never used in implementation)

- **Additional Dead Code Removed**: Also removed `ToDictionaryFromHashFieldArray` method that was only used once and inlined the logic into `GetHashAllAsync` method. Removed 3 associated unit tests.
- **Next Steps**: Consider creating shared CacheUtilities class to eliminate duplication of ValidateKey, ValidateExpiration, SetupRetryPolicy, and LogRetryException methods

### Iteration 6 - SQL Server Provider Security Enhancement  
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Goal**: Remove automatic table creation from SQL Server provider for better security and require manual table setup
- **Changes Made**:
  - [x] Removed automatic table creation logic from SqlServer constructor
  - [x] Replaced `InitializeDatabaseAsync()` with `VerifyTableExistsAsync()` method
  - [x] Added comprehensive error handling with table creation script when table doesn't exist
  - [x] Created `GetCreateTableScript()` method that returns the exact SQL needed

The error messages provide the exact SQL script needed, making setup straightforward. Users can now customize table names, schemas, and permissions as needed for their environment.
- **Next Steps**: Ready for next iteration - consider structured logging, performance monitoring, or code duplication reduction

### Iteration 7 - Code Duplication Elimination  
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Goal**: Refactor common utility methods into shared CacheUtilities class to eliminate ~75% code duplication between Redis.cs and SqlServer.cs
- **Changes Made**:
  - [x] Created new `CacheUtilities` internal static class with shared utility methods
  - [x] Added `ValidateKey(string key)` method with common key validation logic
  - [x] Added `ValidateExpiration(int expireInSeconds)` method with common expiration validation

  - [x] Updated Redis.cs to use CacheUtilities methods, removing duplicated utility methods
  - [x] Updated SqlServer.cs to use CacheUtilities methods, removing duplicated utility methods
  - [x] Updated unit tests to reference CacheUtilities instead of provider-specific methods
  - [x] Verified all 61 tests still pass and solution builds successfully
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `CacheUtilities.cs` (new - shared utility methods)
  - `Redis.cs` (removed 4 utility methods, updated all calls to use CacheUtilities)
  - `SqlServer.cs` (removed 4 utility methods, updated all calls to use CacheUtilities)
  - `Redis_Should.cs` (updated test method calls to use CacheUtilities)
- **Breaking Changes**: No - all changes are internal implementation details
- **Tests Updated**: Yes - updated method references in unit tests, all 61 tests passing
- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**: Successfully eliminated ~75% of code duplication between Redis.cs and SqlServer.cs by moving common utility methods to a shared CacheUtilities class. This improves maintainability by ensuring validation and retry logic is consistent across providers. The refactoring maintains separate retry policies for Redis and SQL Server to handle provider-specific exceptions while sharing the common implementation pattern.
- **Next Steps**: Ready for next iteration - consider structured logging, performance monitoring, or distributed cache patterns

### Iteration 8 - Test Organization Enhancement  
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Goal**: Move SQL Server specific tests to a separate SqlServer_Should.cs file to be consistent with Redis_Should.cs
- **Changes Made**:

  - [x] Moved 5 SQL Server provider tests from CacheProvider_Should.cs to SqlServer_Should.cs  
  - [x] Included private helper methods (CreateConfiguration) in new test file for self-contained testing
  - [x] Verified all 61 tests still pass and solution builds successfully
  - [x] Maintained consistent test structure across all provider types
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `SqlServer_Should.cs` (new - SQL Server specific tests)
  - `Configuration_Should.cs` (removed SqlServerOptions tests)
  - `CacheProvider_Should.cs` (removed SqlServerCacheProvider tests)
- **Breaking Changes**: No - test organization only, no functional changes
- **Tests Updated**: Yes - reorganized tests but maintained all 61 tests, all passing
- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**: Successfully organized tests by provider type for better maintainability and consistency. Each provider now has its own dedicated test file: Redis_Should.cs for Redis tests, SqlServer_Should.cs for SQL Server tests, with shared tests remaining in Configuration_Should.cs and CacheProvider_Should.cs. This makes it easier to find and maintain provider-specific tests.
- **Next Steps**: Ready for next iteration - consider structured logging, performance monitoring, or distributed cache patterns
